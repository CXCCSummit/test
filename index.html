<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cisco Contact Center Enterprise customers can leverage Google Contact Center Artificial Intelligence (CCAI) features like Agent Answers, in which an agent is provided with relevant suggestions and recommendations in real time for the agent to consider. The suggestions and recommendations are based on the ongoing conversation between the caller and the agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Call Transcripts services assist the agents using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU).</p>
<p>These services are available for the agents in the Cisco Finesse desktop gadgets. The Call Transcript gadget dynamically converts the ongoing conversation to text and presents the text to an agent for real-time viewing and reference</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This lab exercises outlines the steps partners or customers need to follow to implement and troubleshoot Agent Answers and Transcripts</p>

<p>Thanks for Completing this lab. Now you can continue with the presentation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Lab 2 Create Knowledge Base and Conversation profile</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lab you will be using your Google project and virtual agent in order to create the knowledge database</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong><em>knowledge base</em></strong>&nbsp;represents a collection of&nbsp;<em>knowledge documents</em>&nbsp;that you provide to Dialogflow. Your knowledge documents are provided to the Finesse agents and contain information that may be useful during the agent conversation with customers. This helps to minimize agents training and improves agents&rsquo; response to customer calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>conversation profile</strong>&nbsp;configures a set of parameters that control the suggestions made to an agent. These parameters control the suggestions that are surfaced during runtime. You must create a conversation profile in order to create a conversation with an end-user.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: You must have provisioned your google project and have created a virtual agent,</strong></p>
