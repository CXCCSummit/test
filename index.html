<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="normal"> Cisco Contact Center Enterprise customers can leverage Google Contact Center Artificial Intelligence (CCAI) features like Agent Answers, in which an agent is provided with relevant suggestions and recommendations in real time for the agent to consider. The suggestions and recommendations are based on the ongoing conversation between the caller and the agent.</p>
<p class="normal"> In addition, Call Transcripts services assist the agents using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU). </p>
<p class="normal"> These services are available for the agents in the Cisco Finesse desktop gadgets. The Call Transcript gadget dynamically converts the ongoing conversation to text and presents the text to an agent for real-time viewing and reference </p>
