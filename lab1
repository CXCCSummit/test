<h1>Lab 1</h1>
<h2>Overview of the lab<h2>
<p>In this Lab, we will go through the tasks that are required to complete the onboarding of a tenant. These tasks are to be undertaken by a customer administrator. By following each of the steps, you would have prepped your tenant to begin configuring different services offered by the platform. At the end of the lab, you should be able to login an agent with either the DN or the configured user extension.</p>
